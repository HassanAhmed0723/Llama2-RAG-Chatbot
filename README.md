# Llama2-RAG-Chatbot
This project is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot utilizing the quantized Llama2 model with 7 billion parameters and LangChain. The chatbot is designed to provide intelligent and contextually relevant responses by combining the power of retrieval-based and generation-based approaches.

## Overview

The Llama2-RAG-Chatbot leverages the Llama2 language model and LangChain to create a highly capable conversational agent. By integrating retrieval-augmented generation, the chatbot can produce more accurate and context-aware responses by retrieving relevant information from a knowledge base and generating coherent responses.
